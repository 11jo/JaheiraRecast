# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = Heidi Shannon (the original voice of Jaheira) was unreachable for Siege of Dragonspear and Beamdog originally cast a new voice actor in the role. Eventually, they decided the new actor was not working out, and left Jaheira's lines unvoiced and her original BG1 soundset. This mod reconnects those files to the dialog lines and gives Jaheira's soundset an SoD update.
